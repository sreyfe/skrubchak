			<h1>Two ice creams, two shmorgasboards</h1>
			<p>A few months ago,
			Mona and I watched a couple of JunkFoodGuru videos on new Magnum
			“Double” flavors. The “Double” line of Magnum is, of course,
			those frozen cream-style pop confections with a choco-style exterior,
			followed by a goo-style semisterior, and ice cream in the middle. The
			“dolphin” or “primate” of the “Double” line is what I
			call the “Double Gold Chocolate Billionaire,” the actual name of
			which is “Double Gold Caramel Billionaire.”</p>

			<p>This is, supposedly,
			“Eis mit Keksgeschmack und Eis mit Pekannussgeschmack umhüllt von
			gesalzener Karamellsauce und goldfarbener Karamellschokolade und
			knusprigen Keksstückchen.” That is: cookie and pecan flavored ice
			cream, covered in salted caramel sauce and gold-caramel chocolate,
			with crispy cookie pieces. Yum yum yum yum yum! It’s really good,
			what can I say. And it’s better in Germany than in the US, so come
			here and try it!</p>

			<p>But anyway,
			JunkFoodGuru put us on to two new flavors: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aepmrp-f90E">Magnum
			Utopia Double Hazelnut</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9NTgvMl35A">Magnum
			Utopia Double Cherry</a>. Mona claims that these are part of the new
			“marble line.” Is it true? Who can tell. I think they were
			marbled already… We were so excited about the the hazelnut one that
			I commented on JFG’s video, and he even responded!</p>

			<p>Let’s just say
			that the utopian aspect of this ice cream was thrice-realized: (1)
			JFG responded. (2) One of the videos, Double Cherry, was set in
			Portugal and we are soon going to Portugal. (3) It’s been a long
			time coming and now we finally get to try the ice creams.</p>

			<p>First up: double
			hazelnut. This was a couple days ago. For lunch, we went to an
			Afghani place near a movie theater north of Innsbrucker. There was
			some sort of spinach and dried lime? Not bad. Very good rice (buttery
			and saffron), and there was a wedding party in the back. A bride
			entered in a white diaphanous situation. At the counter was a picture
			of a soldier. We learned that only 1 in 10,000 oysters has a pearl.</p>

			<p>The movie was “Black
			Bag” (should be called “Not Bad”). We filled up on mixed
			sweet-salty popcorn plus two Allgäuer Büble’s. A few hours later
			we still weren’t hungry. But then sun came through and we simply
			had to go outside and it was then that we decided to finally search
			for this Utopian ice cream. The Spätis nearest to us were closed,
			but the one by Stadtpark was open. We were only really looking for
			the hazelnut, but the cherry was there too! (Talk about a “cherry
			on top”). We came back and made some fried rice with bok choy, fish
			cakes, leftover rice (from a sort of braised chili chicken), and this
			really good fermented soy chili sauce with a camel on it from the
			Vinh Loi on Schlossstrasse.</p>

			<p>We ate. Mona claims
			the Red Sox won. Then, finally: hazelnut time.</p>

			<p>What can we say? Not
			bad. Disappointing. A little anyway. There was some good, slightly
			bitter hazelnut flavor, but the overall palette was like the Double
			Gold Amazin’ Gazillionaire but less intense. Really not so bad.</p>

			<p>The next day we
			returned to the Freie Universität for the first time in a while (for
			Jonah anyway). We got lunch at the Italian: a pizza with artichokes,
			ham, and mushrooms; a salad with tuna; Campari spritz. Mona destroyed
			a flower pot. Our companion got Spaghetti a la Casa, which looked
			delicious and made me a little jealous: Creamy Sauce with
			Rinderfiletspitzen (what in the
			angloid community we might refer to as beef tips(?)). 
			</p>

			<p>Coffee followed.
			Apparently a cortado and an espresso machiato are the same thing?
			Much to consider. We met another friend. He ate a Brötchen with
			arugula-tomato cream or something. Then Mona and I had to split up
			for a while. She had, shall we say, an “appointment.” I headed
			home, but first to Edeka, where I purchased ingredients for the first
			shmorgasboard promised in the title:</p>
				<p>* two types of
				lox (wild and non-wild)</p>
				<p>* Bavarian
				horseradish</p>
				<p>* two types of
				crackers (Finncrisp and sesame)</p>
				<p>* “Westphalian
				pumpernickel”</p>
				<p>* cream cheese,
				plain</p>
				<p>* tomato</p>
				<p>* cucumber</p>
			<br>

			<p>I got home and Mona
			still wasn’t there. I decided to walk around a little and read a
			book. I brought Slotterdijk’s <i>An den Luftbeben des Terrors </i>
			but realized I wanted to read the last section in one go, so I went
			back into Edeka and got a copy of the infamous <i>Berliner
			Zeitung </i>(one Euro forty
			Europennies). I read it in the park for a while. Somewhere along the
			way, I must’ve lost my copy of Slotterdijk, cuz
			I couldn’t find it today.</p>

			<p>This
			first shmorgasboard was really delicious. Maybe my favorite lox
			dinner we’ve ever done? And after dinner… came dessert…</p>

			<p>First
			a couple of squares from Ritter Sport Whole Hazelnut (white chocolate
			with hazelnut and crisp).
			Then … Cherry Utopia
			Magnum. From the first bite on it was delightful. Surprisingly,
			remarkably sour. Tart. It tastes like it looks: purple leaning dark
			red, swirls of pink and semi-dark chocolate. Definitely
			the winner of the two, and a new mainstay for our freezer?</p>

			<p>The
			final shmorg was this morning. It was a light shmorg – really just
			a Brötchenfrühstück. We used the other purchases from the previous
			evening’s Edeka trip: Camembert spread, Roquefort,
			green onions. That plus two
			“knackfrische” Brötchen and an “espresso macchiato”
			from the organic-ass grocery store around the corner,
			as well as some Bavarian quince jam that Mona’s dad made – what a
			breakfast… 
			</p>

			<p>Now,
			night has not yet fallen on
			Berlin. A “Provincial Chicken” remains to be made. There is one
			more Utopia Cherry in the freezer. Bon
			appetit, dear readers. And
			good evening.</p>
