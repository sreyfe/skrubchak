			<h1>The story of Sarah's delicious roast chicken</h1>

			<p>
			The scariest part about making a whole chicken is that I had never
			done it alone. And I wasn’t alone this time – I was with Jack!!
			The night started with Jack and I debating at whose house we should
			make dinner. I didnt’ want to make dinner at my house because I
			spend too much time there. I’ve been unemployed just over four
			months now. (Also, very difficult to cook chicken with my cat,
			Buganome, around). Jack didn’t want to make it at his house for the
			opposite reason. He’s been working too much and hasn’t considered
			his kitchen in a while. We decided on his house.

			<p>Here’s what we
			got:<br>
			1 whole chicken<br>
			1 bag of baby
			potatoes<br>
			3 long hot peppers<br>
			1 shallot<br>
			Bunch of tarragon<br>
			Bunch of rosemary<br>
			Jack made a spice
			mix for the potatoes I think mostly lots of paprika.</p>

			<p>For the pesto-ish
			sauce I made we got:<br>
			Bunch of mint<br>
			Bunch of parsley<br>
			Like 4 golden cherry
			tomatoes<br>
			I also added toasted
			walnuts we already had and lot of olive oil and sherry vinegar</p>

			<p>Even though this is
			a simple chicken, when I was just a kid I never could have imagined
			cooking like this. Chicken was either boiled by my grandmother or
			baked in barbecue sauce and served with ketchup by my father. Jeeps!
			New Jerpsey. Ten-year-old me would probably cry if she knew I was
			making my own sauce…

			<p>Jack spatchcocked
			the chicken while I made a tarragon butter to rub under its skin. I
			told Jack on the bus ride home from the grocery store that I was most
			excited for this part. I can’t explain it well but basically
			rubbing butter under chicken skin is like channeling a past life. And
			yes it’s spiritual but you can also actually feel it, like stomping
			on grapes with bare feet.

			<p>I tinkered the sauce
			while the chicken roasted. It all turned out really good and we were
			eating by 11:30.</p>
