			<h1>Do you know about Cheesling?</h1>

			<p>
			Fried chicken is, at its best, ephemeral. It is at its most delicious
			for a single moment: fresh out of the fryer, crispy, juice
			overflowing on the first bite, and not only as liquid: steaming juice
			overflowing from its liquid state to vapor. Excess transgressing its
			bonds! This moment, fried chicken’s zenith, is unreachable. Perhaps
			fried chicken was eaten at the right moment once in human history.
			Perhaps it has not yet happened, but some day it will, and on that
			day… 
			</p>

			<p>This perfect moment
			is impossible and fried chicken is delicious far past its zenith. The
			10 minutes or so, post-fryer, are fleeting, too, if not as fleeting,
			and even hour-, day-, days-old fried chicken is excellent. But few
			would disagree that it is at its best at its most fleeting, when its
			decay from crunchiness is most rapid, when it stands most
			precariously upon the precipice. To pluck it from this position, to
			destroy it at its peak, this is when fried chicken is best.</p>

			<p>Have the Koreans
			perfected fried chicken? I can’t say for sure. Certainly, rice
			flour introduces a degree and quality of crunch heretofore unknown to
			the western world. But I write not here of Korean fried chicken per
			se, but of its greatest innovation: yes, I write of Cheesling.</p>

			<p>If you do not know
			it, Cheesling is Korean fried chicken which dusted with a cheese
			powder. The cheese powder adheres to the fried skin, but also rests
			in a powdery matrix above it. To perturb the chicken perturbs this
			superior layer of cheese powder and it is liable to slide down and
			off your chicken. You must be careful.</p>

			<p>You may wonder what
			I mean by cheese powder. It is not the cheese powder of Cheetos or
			Doritos. Its closest cousin, as far as I can tell, is the cheese
			powder from boxed mac and cheese. Do you remember, as a child, taking
			a bit of this powder, putting it on your tongue, feeling it dissolve
			into pure cheese, ideal cheese, or something like it? I do. And I
			remember this every time I eat Cheesling.</p>

			<p>The beauty of
			Cheesling is that it respects and amplifies the natural ephemerality
			of fried chicken. This is, for one, exemplified by the powdery matrix
			of cheese. There is an endless number of permutations of cheese
			particles. Each time you eat Cheesling, you are guaranteed to eat
			something you have never eaten before. But wait, you might say, is
			this not true of every food? Is this not true of everything you
			consume and everything you do? Yes, you are correct. But Cheesling
			wears it on its sleeve.</p>

			<img src="/assets/img/cheesling_fig_6.png" alt="fig 6: sleeve" >

			<p>But the true
			fleeting beauty of Cheesling is the moment of contact between cheese
			powder and tongue. How long is this moment? It is infinitesimal. In a
			sense, it doesn’t exist at all. But there it is. Like the moment
			you put boxed mac and cheese powder on your tongue – it is gone as
			soon as it is there, but there it is.</p>
